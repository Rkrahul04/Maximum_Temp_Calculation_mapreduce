# Maximum_Temp_Calculation_mapreduce
maximum temperature calculation using mapreduce
A MapReduce program to process a dataset with multiple temperatures for a year. You need to process the dataset to
find out the maximum temperature for each year in the dataset.

Problem Explanation:
In this data set, the first field represents the year and the second field represents the temperature in
that year. As the temperature will not be constant throughout the year, each year has multiple
temperatures listed in the dataset. You need to process the dataset and find the maximum
temperature during a year. Here is the sample output: 
 
Sample Output  
Year Maximum Temperature  
1900   36 
1901   48 
1902   49 

Our task is to process the ‘temperature’ records using MapReduce program and find out the maximum temperature during each year in this dataset.
